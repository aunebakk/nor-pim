# Nor-Pim - Open Source

Nor-Pim is a Product Information Management System written for enterprise cloud environments with user interfaces tailored for PC, Web and Mobile. It is centered around Microsoft products like SQL Server, Azure, Visual Studio, C# and TypeScript.

A major part of the code is produced by a Code Generator [sql2x](www.sql2x.org). The general idea is to use as few frameworks and dependencies as possible in order to make a product that will stand the test of time without having to be rewritten when technology shifts happens and frameworks and dependencies become incompatible.

The remaining part of code mainly consists of user interface tweaks to support new user interface trends and fads, business layer code to interact with other systems, import/export, etc.

The example catalog and product data is all Latin "Lorem ipsum" Gibberish, this to take focus away from the data as any product related data can be handled by Nor-Pim.

The goal of Open Sourcing Nor-Pim is to attract organizations/developers to make user interfaces tailored towards more specialized businesses while keeping the core sturdy enough to handle both small and large sets of products as effective as possible on the infrastructure it runs on. 

Currently Nor-Pim runs on SQL Server using only Tables, Columns and Relations, no Stored Procedures or Functions. This makes Nor-Pim easily adaptable to other databases. Same with the business layer where dotNetCore under Linux is in the [pipeline](#pipeline). The business logic in the tailored code of Nor-Pim is not expected to change at all during this transition from WCF/SOAP to REST. And the tailored user interface code should stay the same as SQL2X provides the same client side proxy for REST interfaces as SOAP did.

Live [Nor-Pim running under Azure](http://www.NorPim.com). In this configuration all 3 FrontEnds runs under one Azure App, the WCF/SOAP layer in another one and finally Azure SQL Database on a third server.

# Nor-Pim
[Nor-Pim](http://www.NorPim.com) Product Information Management - Structured product specific attributes for Windows / Web and Mobile platform.

Nor-Pim is a Product Information Management System written for enterprise cloud environments with user interfaces tailored for PC, Web and Mobile.

Nor-Pim is used for managing structured product specific attributes which is either maintained manually or automatically through interfaces to other systems.

Nor-Pim provides full access to a product and it's structure with a fixed or customized API through WCF/SOAP interfaces.

Nor-Pim also acts as a proof of concept for a three tiered cloud based "Line-of-Business" system that features:

 - SQL Server database
 - Business layer through WCF/SOAP / ASP
 - FrontEnd's consuming the WCF/SOAP layer :
   - Windows application ( Full Maintenance Capabilities )
   - Web Site ( Browsing and editing products / product bucket )
   - Mobile Hybrid App ( Browsing and editing products / product bucket )

# Documentation 3
Documentation level has been turned on High for this release, which means the following is included for all namespaces, classes and methods:
 - Header: sql2x internal documentation block
 - Level one comment: block comment, a high level one liner about the following code
 - Level two comment: in depth comment, comprehensive information about the following code
 - Level three comment: low level comments, meant for educational purposes
 - Links: Wikipedia and or Microsoft documentation links for in-depth study 
 - DocGuid: SQL2X internal GUID used for debugging

Nor-Pim uses no special frameworks outside of the dotNetFramework ecosystem in an effort to make it as scalable and maintainable as possible, this is made possible by using a tool to generate boiler plate code for efficient communication between layers ( SQL2X ). Since the code is bare bone C# and TypeScript it is easier to find developers to maintain / enhance the code.

# Cost
The 2 web apps run under Azure on a Windows Standard (S1: 1) App Service Plan with a monthly cost of 40 USD with an Azure SQL server tier speced at Standard S0: 10 DTUs with a monthly cost of 12 USD.
The system could run on a lower spec but would obviously be slower than it currently is. 

This is a development setup however and it would deliver a bad customer experience in terms of response time should the requests per minute increase beyond what the test engine currently delivers. 

But scaling up is where Nor-Pim and Azure shines. There are no legacy Virtual Machine software involved, no old software running behind some fancy API in a Microservice setup, just clean C# in dotNetCore and dotNetFramework running without expensive frameworks which is hard to beat performance wise on the same hardware specification.

| toSQLServerLocalTrusted               | Create a trusted ADO connection string to a local SQL Server

**From PowerShell**
```
# this will insert ADO connection strings to a local trusted sql server, typical for a development environment

& '.\Operational\De-Sanitize Connection.ps1' `
   -toSQLServerLocalTrusted:$true

& '.\Operational\Environment Switch.ps1' `
   -toRemote:$false
```
 **From Visual Studio 2017**
 - Clean build
 - Run DatabaseManager to create the Database and populate it's tables
 - Select Business and Web as startup
 - Run

   -toRemote:$true
```
**The Web and Window FrontEnd's**
```
NuGet.exe restore .\SolutionNorSolutionPim.sln ( Download NuGet here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-4.9-rtm )
& '.\Operational\Restore packages.bat'
& '.\WinForm\Operational\Publish WinForm layer to ASP site install directory.bat'
& '.\Web\Operational\Get-Web-App-PublishingProfile.ps1' 
& '.\Web\Operational\Build package to disk.bat'
& '.\Web\Operational\Publish To Azure.bat'
```
At this point the FrontEnd can only be used to bring up the start page and the about box.

**The Business Layer**
```
& '.\Business\Operational\Get-Web-App-PublishingProfile.ps1'
& '.\Business\Operational\Build package to disk.bat'
& '.\Business\Operational\Publish To Azure.bat'
```
**The Database**

The web FrontEnd is responsible for creating and updating the database, so the FrontEnd needs to be published before the database can be created. 

 - https://XXX.azurewebsites.net/database
   - Database Management Create Database
   - Database Management Set Version Zero Database
   - Database Management Increase Version To Latest step by step
   - Database Management Version Object ( Should be 0.14.0 )

## SQL2X
Nor-Pim is in large part made by an Visual Studio Extension named SQL2X. Metadata and Code from this tool is found around the codebase, indications are:
 - SchemaTemplates folders, these are .json files that directly corresponds to database tables and have no influence on how Nor-Pim runs but are used by the SQL2XLite extension for further development.
 - CRUDE ( Create Read Update Delete & Extras ) folders are the direct result of SchemaTemplates .json files, i.e. automatic code generated by SQL2x, feel free to modify this code as you see fit, there are no other dependencies on this code except other layers that interact with it's methods.
 - Durian folders comes from Ansi SQL Select statements in the Data tier.
 - Operational folders contain PowerShell and Batch scripts used to recompile and republish that part of the product, our approach to CI/CD.
